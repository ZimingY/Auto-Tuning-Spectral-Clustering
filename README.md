Python3 code for the IEEE SPL paper ["Auto-Tuning Spectral Clustering for SpeakerDiarization Using Normalized Maximum Eigengap"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CdEJPrpW6pRCObrppcZnw0_hRwWIHxi8/view?usp=sharing)




## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The required python3 libraries:
```
scikit-learn==0.22
kaldi_io==0.9.1
```
Use _*install_venv.sh*_ to install the necessary python libraries

You have to first have [_virtualenv_ ](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) installed on your machine. Install [_virtualenv_ ](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) with the following command:
```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv 
```

If you installed virtualenv, run the "install_venv.sh" script to make a virtual-env.
```
./install_venv.sh
```
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
